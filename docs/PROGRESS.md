# PROGRESS.md — build log

This log is the project's memory across sessions. Every subtask gets an entry: what
was done, the command/output that proves the DoD passed, and anything discovered that
affects later phases. Written so the next session can work from this file alone.

Format per entry:

```
## phase-N.M — <title>   (<date>)
**Done:** ...
**DoD proof:** <command> → <result>
**Notes / affects later phases:** ...
**Commit:** <hash>

## phase-0.1 — Repo scaffold + Python tooling   (2026-09-08)

**Done:**
- Directory tree per REBUILD_SPEC §5: `app/{omr,grading,pdf,web,config}`, `corpus/{images,labels,_source}`, `tests/`, `deploy/`, `scripts/`, `.github/workflows/`.
- `pyproject.toml` — runtime deps (Django 5.1, psycopg3, django-q2, gunicorn, reportlab, qrcode, Pillow, PyMuPDF, pyzbar) + `[dev]` (ruff, pytest, pytest-django); ruff + pytest config. `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE` intentionally deferred to 0.2.
- `.gitignore`, `.gitattributes` (corpus/PDF/PNG = binary; LFS decision deferred to 0.7), `README.md`.
- `docs/PROGRESS.md` header.
- `tests/test_purity.py` — subprocess check that `app.omr` / `app.grading` import with no django/flask/fastapi/starlette in `sys.modules` (CLAUDE.md rule 7).
- `tests/test_sanity.py` — runner liveness.

**DoD proof:**
- `python -m venv .venv && .venv/Scripts/python -m pip install -e ".[dev]"` → `Successfully installed Django-5.1.15 ... ruff-0.16.6 ...` (exit 0)
- `.venv/Scripts/ruff check .` → `All checks passed!` (exit 0)
- `.venv/Scripts/python -m pytest -q` → `2 passed in 0.12s` (exit 0), purity + sanity
- `.venv/Scripts/python -c "import pyzbar.pyzbar, fitz, reportlab, qrcode"` → `imports ok` (pyzbar bundled zbar DLL works on this Windows box)

**Notes / affects later phases:**
- `reportlab` resolved to **5.0.1** (constraint was `>=4.2`); no API concerns expected for coordinate drawing but pin exact in Phase 4 if proof-print output shifts.
- `PyMuPDF` import as `fitz` is deprecated → use `import pymupdf` in new code (Phase 0.5, Phase 5).
- Dev env is a project-local `.venv` (Windows paths: `.venv/Scripts/...`). CI (0.4) and docker (0.3) will use Linux paths.
- No Django project yet — `pytest` runs plain; `manage.py` / `app/settings.py` land in 0.2.

**Commit:** 19b8573 (+ f33e7b0 line-ending follow-up)
